Make a schematic/footprint for the key-holder

Use heirarchical sheets to do the schematic design, with the "simple" layout just for the keys

Use https://github.com/gauravmm/HierarchicalPcb to replicate

Finalize PCB


Use sk6812 5050 for led, but check it's relatively solderable pads

caps: dont go smaller than 0805?

good TMR @ digikey: RR112-1G42-531 or CT8150 
good double quad mux @ digikey: MC74LVX4052 or maybe TMUX1309A

possible revisions for r2:
* make xiao pads easier to solder
* make battery holes wider?  
* R1-> 1M
* add nmos with gate on pin 7/D6, source grd, drain connected to Q2 gate
